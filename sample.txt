Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity today. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a warming effect known as global warming. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency measures, reforestation, and sustainable agricultural practices are other important strategies.
